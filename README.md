# flying-around-the-globe-via-graphs
This repository is for my CSC111 Final Project.

The goal of the final project was to use graphs or trees, two major data structures we covered in the course, to solve any problem we wanted.
I completed this project with three other group members: Aaditya Mandal, Faraz Hossein, and Dinkar Verma.

Our project is called: Flying Around the Globe Via Graphs.
Using Python the programming language and plotly, NetworkX, and Dash as our main libraries, we created a program that allows a user to plan their local and international flights.
The user selects inputs from dropdown menus, such as the source city, destination city, number of stops (optional), and stopover locations (optional). Our algorithm then takes those inputs and visually plots up to three of the best flight routes for their requirements.
