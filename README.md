# flying-around-the-globe-via-graphs
This repository is for my CSC111 Final Project.

The goal of the final project was to use graphs or trees, two major data structures we covered in the course, to solve any problem we wanted.
I completed this project with three other group members: Aaditya Mandal, Faraz Hossein, and Dinkar Verma.

## Background
Our project is called: Flying Around the Globe Via Graphs.
Using the Python programming language and plotly, NetworkX, and Dash as our main libraries, we created a program that allows a user to plan their local and international flights.
The user selects inputs from dropdown menus, such as the source city, destination city, number of stops (optional), and stopover locations (optional). Our algorithm then takes those inputs and visually plots up to three of the best flight routes for their requirements.

## Instructions
To run the program:
  - [Download the latest version of PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
  - Download all the files in this repository
  - Download the Python libraries listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/yousufhassan/flying-around-the-globe-via-graphs/blob/main/requirements.txt)
  - Open the [main.py](https://github.com/yousufhassan/flying-around-the-globe-via-graphs/blob/main/main.py) file in PyCharm and right click to run it in the Python Console
  - Click the Dash link in the Python Console which will open the program in your internet browser.

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Some ideas we brainstormed as 'next steps' are:
  - Incorporating additional filters such as price range
  - Improving the visualizations to be cleaner, such as:
    - Having each flight route be a separate colour
    - Combining the multiple NetworkX traces that form a flight route into one single NetworkX trace
  - Further cleaning up some aspects of the code
